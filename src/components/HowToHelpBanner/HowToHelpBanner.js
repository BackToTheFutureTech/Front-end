        <p>
        Volunteering is important as it offers essential help to worthwhile causes, people in need, and the wider community. Indeed, many organisations and charities rely on the generosity of volunteers as often they are only part-funded through government or local councils, and cannot afford to pay salaries for all their staff. In fact, many companies depend almost solely upon teams of volunteers to help them thrive and do their work.
          </p>
        <p>But did you realise just how important volunteering could be for the person doing it? In fact, volunteering is beneficial to the doer for a whole host or reasons, including stress reduction, combating depression and providing a sense of purpose. It is an opportunity to meet people who you might not normally connect with: people from different age groups, ethnicities or social groups. Mental health is boosted simply because volunteering makes you happier; the so-called 'helper's high'. Human beings are hard-wired to give to others, and by measuring so-called brain activity and happiness hormones, researchers have found that being helpful to others can deliver great pleasure.</p>
